A wordpress website for the Tiny Baby Talk Show

This project will use various tutorials and web resources to create my first
wordpress website. All sources will be cited.

Many thanks to Mike Levin (youtube.com/https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd26IHBHcbtxD7pUdnIgiCw) for providing tutorials on the RaspberryPi, git, vim, etc.
